## Purpouse

The purpose of this project is to provide a generic RESTful API server based on mocked responses, defined programatically and with support to many features like: 

- Basic Auth
- Cookies
- HTTP endpoints with support to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE actions

## Usage

### Project Routes

This project is based on the concepts of [Express.js routing](http://expressjs.com/guide/routing.html). Those features are provided by a library called [dynamic-routes](https://github.com/OneOfOne/dynamic-routes), and all routes can be defined programatically with support to all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) within the **routes** folder.

To know better these routes conventions, take a look on the project examples to understand the concepts. 

### Project Mocks

This project is also based on mocked responses, defined programatically in a convetional manner, within the **mocks** folder

#### Mocks path structure

The mocks path structure are the defined based on routes path. For example, suppose we have an **/foo** route defined on the project, with support to GET action. The respective mocked reponse of this route is structured as follows:

```
- mocks
|-- foo
|--- get
|---- all.json
|---- 1.json
|---- foo=bar.json
```

This structure is also adaptive to define mocked responses for POST, PUT and DELETE actions whenever necessary.

#### Mock response structure

All mock responses also are based on some conventions, defined in a structure as follows:

```json
{
	"code": 200,
	"content" : { 
		"bar" 
	}
}
```

This structure defines a response HTTP code (with support to all [HTTP codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)) and payload, represented by **content** node.

#### Response for Path Param Request

A GET request on a route path with path param like **/foo/1** is conventionally mapped to *1.json* file, defined in a structure like shown below:

```
- mocks
|-- foo
|--- get
|---- 1.json
```

#### Response for Query Param Request

A GET request on a route path with query param like **/foo/?foo=bar&bar=foo**, its convetionally mapped to a *foo=bar&bar=foo.json* file, defined in a structure like shown below:

```
- mocks
|-- foo
|--- get
|---- foo=bar&bar=foo.json
```

#### Response for Subresource Request

A GET request on a route path defined for a subresource like **/foo/1/bar/2**, its convetionally mapped to a *1_2.json* file, defined in a structure like shown below:

```
- mocks
|-- foo
|--- bar
|---- get
|---- 1_2.json
```

#### Default responses with MockHTTP

All requests received from your project routes could be conventioned to have a defined mocked response. For GET methods like **/foo**, its expected to have a *all.json* file defined to response for the request. In case of PUT or DELETE actions, the default response is agreed to be defined with HTTP Code 204 without any body. In case of POST requests, the default response is defined to have HTTP Code 200 without any body.

In case of some route doesnÂ´t have its respective mocked response, a message will be sent with HTTP Code 404 and body with a descriptive error message.

This behavior could be easily supported by your project's routes through a library MockHTTP, defined on this project. To know better this libray usage, take a look at this project example section.
